== First step

As seen in link:concept.html[Concept] page TSM relies on a git repository and SSH
to connect to servers. If you want to be able to deploy Tribestream as well you will
need to setup a Tomitribe account.

Since all this configuration is common to most of applications you can save it in a
file reused by all commands and avoid to fill all these parameters for all commands.

By default TSM uses `~/.tsmrc` but it provides `configuration reload` commands to load another
configuration file if you use the interactive mode.

=== Configure git client in ~/.tsmrc

TSM git connection is done through SSH connection which is compatible with most of git servers
(typically github).

The typical configuration for git looks like:

[source,properties]
----
git.repository: myOrganisation/myTsmRepository <1>
git.base: git@github.com <2>
git.sshKey: /path/to/myGitSshKey.pem <3>
git.sshPassphrase: base64:myPassWordInBase64 <4>
----

<1> which repository to use to find TSM configuration.
<2> which git base do you use, if you use github it is `git@github.com` for the public instance and `git@github.company.com` for enterprise instances.
<3> the ssh key you use to close the TSM git repository.
<4> the passphrase used with the ssh key if any. You can encode it in base64 prefixing the base64 encoded value by `base64:` if you want.


NOTE: the password only uses Base64 encoding but keep in mind you deploy from your account/machine so
you don't need a highly secure storage normally (if you use ubuntu, account home encryption is enough for instance).


=== Configure SSH connection

To connect to machine through SSH you can also setup the SSH key you use and its passphrase:

[source,properties]
----
ssh.path: /path/to/myGitSshKey.pem <1>
ssh.passphrase: base64:myPassWordInBase64 <2>
----

<1> as for `git.sshKey` just specify the path to the ssh key you use to connect on the servers (it can be the same as git one or not).
<2> the passphrase in clear or base64 allowing to use the SSH key specified in 1.

=== Integrate with Tribestream and Tomitribe Download Area

If you want to use TSM to deploy Tomitribe Tribestream and be able to list available versions you need a Tomitribe account.

To get an account just go on http://www.tomitribe.com/downloads/[Tomitribe Download Area] and create an account
clicking on Register button:

image::../images/tomitribe-register.png[Tomitribe Register,align="center"]

Then once you submitted the registration form and you can click on Login and access the download area you can configure TSM to use your account
to get Tribestream integration.

To do so you just need to fill your username and password in `~/.tsmrc`:

[source,properties]
----
www.tomitribe.com.username: myusername <1>
www.tomitribe.com.password: base64:myPasswordBase64 <2>
----

<1> the username you selected for the download area.
<2> the associated password.

=== Environments and defaults

==== Ports

This part is optional but TSM links deployment to an environment. Sometimes this notion is called a "Stage".
Idea is to be able to deploy easily and almost identically the same application to different environments.

For TSM an environment is by convention a folder but it can be linked to ports for the server, TSM providing some placeholders
for HTTP, HTTPS and SHUTDOWN ports automatically allowing you to keep your configuration simple (it will be detailled in another part).

Out of the box TSM only knows `prod` environment and associate it the following ports:

[cols="2*", options="header",frame="all"]
[.table.table-bordered]
|====
| Name     | Value
| HTTP     | 8080
| HTTPS    | 8443
| SHUTDOWN | 8005
|====

If you want to customize the port or add the support for more environments you can specify a `environment.defaults.configuration.file`
entry in your `~/.tsmrc` pointing to a JSON file listing all supported environments:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "dev":{
    "tsm.http": 6080,
    "tsm.https": 6443,
    "tsm.shutdown": 6005,
    "tsm.portMarker": 6,
    "tsm.environment": "pi"
  },
  "staging":{
    "tsm.http": 7080,
    "tsm.https": 7443,
    "tsm.shutdown": 7005,
    "tsm.portMarker": 7,
    "tsm.environment": "pd"
  },
  "prod":{
    "tsm.http": 8080,
    "tsm.https": 8443,
    "tsm.shutdown": 8005,
    "tsm.portMarker": 8,
    "tsm.environment": "prod"
  }
}
----

All these variables are added to the selected environment as usable placeholders in your filtered configuration files.
You don't need to respect `tsm.x` naming but it is what is used by the implicit configuration file.

==== Default environment

If you have a single environment or if you want to be sure to avoid to deploy in production inintentionally
you can set an `environment` in your `~/.tsmrc`:

[source,properties]
----
environment: dev <1>
----

<1> ensures you deploy in `dev` environment if you don't specify the environment in the command you execute.

== Create your first TSM git repository

Once you create a git repository on your platform clone it locally and create a folder for your application
named as the `artifactId` of your application (hello for this example) and a `deployments.json` file inside:

[source]
----
.
└── hello
    └── deployments.json
----

=== Deployments.json

`deployments.json` is the file describing the basic setup for your application:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "user": "myUser", <1>
  "base": "/opt/applications/", <2>
  "environments": [
    {
      "names": [ "prod" ], <3>
      "hosts": [ "host1", "host2" ], <4>
      "properties": { <5>
        "someKey": "someValue"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> the SSH user to use to connect to the machines.
<2> where to install the application.
<3> the list of environment names matching this configuration.
<4> the host to use for this (these) environment(s).
<5> some key value pairs you can reuse as placeholders in your application configuration.

=== Configuration

For Tomcat/TomEE/Tribestream deployment you often need to specify some configuration files.

For such deployment you can some folders hosting the templates to deploy. All environments will inherit from
`tribestream` folder and you can consider this folder as `tomcat.base` one (ie you can add inside a conf/, a bin/... folder).

If all your environments don't use the same configuration and you can't use placeholders to differentiate them
you can create a `tribestream-<environment>` with the configuration dedicated to this environment.

TIP: if several environments share the same specific configuration you can add in your environment object a `deployerProperties`
object with `tribestream.folder` overriding the suffix to use:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "user": "myUser",
  "base": "/opt/applications/",
  "environments": [
    {
      "names": [ "staging", "prod" ],
      "hosts": [ "host1", "host2" ],
      "deployerProperties": {
        "tribestream.folder": "final" <1>
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> instead of using either `tribestream-staging` or `tribestream-prod` TSM will use `tribestream-final` for both environments.


A standard Tomcat setup contains a `logging.properties`, `server.xml` and a ssl.jks if you use HTTPS.
A TomEE or Tribestream likely often contains a `system.properties`.

Supposing our Hello application needs a TomEE we will likely create a git repository with the following layout:

[source]
----
.
└── hello
    ├── deployments.json <1>
    ├── tribestream <2>
    │   └── conf
    │       ├── logging.properties
    │       ├── server.xml
    │       ├── ssl.jks
    │       └── system.properties
    ├── tribestream-dev <3>
    │   └── conf
    │       └── ssl.jks
    └── tribestream-prod <3>
        └── conf
            └── ssl.jks
----

<1> the dpeloyments.json defining our to deploy to all our environments.
<2> the shared configuration between `dev` and `prod`. It can use filtering to specify some specificity of the environment in the configuration files.
<3> specific configuration folders. Here we use it only for the HTTPS keystore which are binary files (so not specifying through filtering).

=== Default scripts and Hooks

By default TSM will create for your application several built-in scripts in your application bin directory:

[cols="2*", options="header",frame="all"]
[.table.table-bordered]
|====
| Name          | Usage
| processes     | list processes associated to application directory
| setenv.sh     | the standard Tomcat setenv.sh
| startup       | starts the application
| shutdown      | stops the application
|====


If the default TSM scripts are not enough for you, TSM supports few events you can use to add scripts
before/after startup and shutdown:

[cols="2*", options="header",frame="all"]
[.table.table-bordered]
|====
| Name               | Event
| pre_startup.sh     | executed before the server starts.
| post_startup.sh    | executed after the server start command.
| pre_shutdown.sh    | executed before the server stops.
| post_shutdown.sh   | executed after the server stop command.
|====




Now you are all setup to use TSM let's start to use it with its link:commands.html[Commands].

TSM is designed as a remote deployer. The intention is to automate the deployment process of an application
on a UNIx server.

Here is the overall architecture of TSM:

TSM configuration is read from Git (can be github or any git repository),
from this configuration TSM knows which servers are targetted by the deployer
just referencing on the command line the application and the environment.

Then if TSM needs any binaries it goes on a maven repository(ies) (Nexus most of the time but any Maven repository
hosting maven metadata works) to get the binaries (server, application, ...).

Finally once TSM got all binaries it deploys the configuration hosted in git for the application
and the downloaded binaries.

To create your first TSM repository you can go on the link:setup.html[Setup] documentation.

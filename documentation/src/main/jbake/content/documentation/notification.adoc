TSM supports some basic client notifications. For now it is mainly Slack integration.

Configuration is as follow:

TIP: if no artifactid is set then the configuration is global for all deployments but if you set it as suffix then
it is specific to a single deployment. Ex: `slack.active.mydeployment = false`.
